# Too Much Freedom

Random grievances about that country with too much freedom.

Please don't take anything here too seriously!

I get upset when I talk about any of these issues and am met with a combinaistion of:

 * "There is a work around for this" Just fix the problem!
 * "It's the same everywhere else and it's okay"  No it's not!


## Basic day to day life issues

### Ice cubes

I don't want to numb my face everytime I drink something. 'Refreshing' doesn't necessarily mean 'Zero degrees'.
No ice please.

### Units

SI.

Anything else is absolute madness.

#### Cooking

Cups? Seriously? Measuring non-liquid stuff by volume? are you insane?


#### Time and Date

"This tragic event happened on 3/2/11 at 12:00pm" doesn't mean anything:

  * 12 hours "post meridiem" means midnight, not noon.
  * MM/DD/YY is absolute madness. 

ISO 8601 uber alles!

Because there are only 12 (and not 14) months, and because |π - 22/7| < |π - 3.14|, "Pi day" is actually the 22nd of July.

### Money

#### Currency

So much to say there:

  * All the bills look the same
  * Need to keep a huge bunch of $1 bills for the stupid tipping
  * Bills from an ATM are always kind of gross and smell like ass
  * Since there is no way to pre-compute how much you're going to pay while you queue because all prices are without VAT, you always end up with a bunch of coins you can't do anything with

#### Credit Card

Seriously feels like this is stone age.

This is what paying at a restaurant's process should be:

  0) Waiter comes with a machine
  0) You give your card to the waiter
  0) He inserts your card and types the amount you should pay
  0) Optionnally add a tip
  0) You type your pin
  0) Machine auths and prints a paper to confirm transaction

Total time taken: 1 minute

Cons: 

  * You have to remember your PIN

This is what it's like in crazy places:

  0) Waiter comes and takes your card
  0) Waiter goes away, gets distracted
  0) Waiter finally finds time to go to a machine, swipe your card to print a receipt with your card details, and how much you're paying
  0) Waiter comes back, with all you need for your maths homework: your credit card, a pen, paper receipts, and copies
  0) You are now tasked with calculating a Tip, as well as the global sum, write everything down, and sign

Total time taken: 10 minutes.

Cons:

  * Takes forever, while someone else is in possession of your card
  * You have to do maths homework
  * Authentication is based on whether you can scribble with a pen

### Bathroom

#### Showers

What's wrong with tubes? Please stop attaching the showerhead to the wall, especially right in front of my face so that I have to bow and do gymnastics to wash my hair. Here I am in the morning doing the little dance trying to move around so that some droplets actually reach my butt and feet trying to rince the soap off.

You sound so smug with your "off courses you turn the shower on first and then step in, lol noob". You ever heard about just controlling where the water goes? Anoter case of "We have a solution for this problem" where nobody ever realize they should fix the problem in the first place.

Want to rinse the shower after your finished, to remove disgraceful hair in your host's shower? tough luck trying to use your hands as water buckets.

Can I please control temperature AND flow? You have that for your hands in the sink, why not your shower?

#### Toilets stall doors

Why do you need 12cm gaps all around the door?

This is making enough people uncomfortable that a company is actually selling things to closes thoses gaps

While having a gap at the bottom of the door could make cleaning easier, there is no reason why I need to be able to slip a laptop through the stupid side gaps. PRIVACY PLEASE.

#### Someone else will clean your shit

Why so many hotels/offices/restaurants don't have the brush that helps you clean after yourself when you make a mess?


### Light

Light bulb 'turn knobs' thingies are not a valid way to turn a light on/off. These things feel very flimsy and way too close to the high voltage powered heat generating device to make me comfortable.
I shouldn't have to fish for it while blinded by the bulb to turn the whole thing off before going to bed.

### TV

Television is the worst. US TV is the worst of television. It feels like 50% of it is *ads*.

It's mind blowing that you get ads for:
* Prescription only medication
* Doctors
* Lawyers

## Systemic issues

### Quick buck is the law

Most things feel like they were done this way to make as much money as possible  NOW whatever the cost.


### Immigration

We get it, you all hate foreigners. Thank you for making visiting an super humiliating process.

Not even setting actual foot in the country, got a tight connection to catch another flight? Tough luck, still got to pickup your luggage and do the whole security dance again.

### Alchohol ban

Make something illegal, and a taboo, and people will do crazy shit with it.

Lots of places allow people to have a cold beer in a park and don't suffer from much issues related to public inhebriation.

Enforce the ban of unappropriate behavior instead, like being an annoying drunkard.

### Guns

Seriously get your shit together.

It's terrifying to know I may get shot because I was pulled over and started foraging for my papers in the glove box.

"It's very unlikely any of this will happen to you". Sure. Yet it does happen, unlike every other sane place in the world, where it doesn't:

 * [Police shoots at unarmed person and hits only bypassers](https://www.villagevoice.com/2016/08/10/after-the-nypd-opened-fire-on-an-unarmed-mentally-ill-man-in-times-square-who-gets-the-blame/)
 * [Police shoots & kills unarmed person in hotel because he didn't want to lose his pants after being ordered to crawl on the flor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Daniel_Shaver)

### Tipping

Because paying workers for their job is apparently a terrible idea.

Appart from this absolutely basic respect for your employees, this allows all kind of horrible stuff.

  * Horrible people can just not tip, and screw over the employees, with no issue for them
  * Easy to forget to do
  * Calculation based on a percentage of the full bill means waiters in a less fancy restaurant will be paid less for the same work
  * Waiters will be overly frendly, which is actually super annoying

Why should this be only applied to waiters? Why not all service customer facing services?

Just pay people well, and they'll be happier and do a better job.

A tip should be an extraordinary token of appreciation for an extraordinary good job. Like it is in so many countries.
